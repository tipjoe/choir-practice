They\nWhipped and they stripped and they hung me on high, and they\nLeft me there on a cross to die. \n\n“Dance, then, dance, then,\nI’m the Lord of the Dance,” said he, “and I’ll\nLead you all, wherever you may be, and I’ll\nLead you all in the Dance,” said he.\n\nDance, dance, dance, dance,\nDance, dance, dance, dance,\nDance, dance, dance, dance,\nDance, dance, wherever you may be:\n\nThey cut me down and I leapt on high;\n“I am the Life that’ll never, never die. I’ll\nLive in you if you’ll live in me;\nI am the Lord of the Dance,” said he.\n\n“Dance, then, dance, then,\nI’m the Lord of the Dance,” said he, “and I’ll\nLead you all, wherever you may be, and I’ll\nLead you all in the Dance,” said he."
